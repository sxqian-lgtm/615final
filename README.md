## Abstract
Kodiak Island, Alaska, supports diverse fish populations, whose spatial distribution and life-cycle stages are critical for effective fisheries management. This project investigates the spatial patterns of fish species and their life-cycle stages across Kodiak Island using data from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. A total of 2,078 spatial sampling points were analyzed, representing species such as Coho, Sockeye, Chum, Pink, and King Salmon, as well as Dolly Varden and Sheefish, with life stages including parr, resident, and smolt.

The data were cleaned, spatially filtered to Kodiak Island, and reshaped into a tidy format, forming the summarized dataset fish_stat. Geospatial analyses included interactive maps of sampling points, polygon-level species and cycle distribution, and species-specific life-cycle distribution across lakes and streams. Bar charts and pie charts were used to summarize counts and composition, while a Shiny web application was developed to enable exploration of species- and life-cycle-specific patterns.

Results indicate that fish observations are concentrated along rivers, streams, and lakes, with notable variation in species composition and life-cycle stage distribution across polygons. This project shows how R, Quarto, and Shiny can be integrated to produce professional reports and interactive tools for ecological data analysis, providing insights for habitat use and fisheries management.
